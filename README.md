# Custom API

This is the example that we are going to follow in the blog post for www.victorsolaya.com -> www.victorsolaya.com/blog/customapi

This is written in C# and it is just an example to be followed.

It contains three classes:

- CreateDadzJoke -> This is the main class
- DadzJokeResponse -> Class to set the response which comes from the API
- DeserializeJson -> It is a class just to deserialize the JSON that comes from the API. It is needed so we don't use Newtonsoft.JSON
